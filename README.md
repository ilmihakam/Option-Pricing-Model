# Option-Pricing-Model

Hello, this is my first ever project. I am doing this because I want to apply my knowledge in algorithms and data structures as well as statistics, probability and mathematics in a field that I am interested in right now. 

The project is related to quantitative finance and it specifically relates to option trading using High Frequency Trading (HFT) models to build a bot that considers the factors that affect option trading in relevant markets. Thanks
